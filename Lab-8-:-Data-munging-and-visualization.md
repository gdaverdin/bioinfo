Today we will use R to visualize RNAseq-based gene expression using heatmaps. R is a statistical computing language that is open source and free (unlike SAS). https://www.r-project.org

# Install packages in R

Base or "vanilla" R is plenty powerful and useful, but the benefit of having an open source platform is that anyone can write packages that have specific, improved functions in them. R has a few built-in ways of downloading and installing packages, which makes this extra useful.

My favorite package for plotting data is ggplot2. It is written by Hadley Wickham, a notable R guru. He also develops and maintains a few other packages, most known by RStudio (an R GUI). 

    install.packages("ggplot2")
