For your final project for this class, you have quite a bit of freedom, but the foundation must including generating a genome assembly, transcriptome assembly, or variant identification. This will culminate in a short presentation (10-15min) describing 

* your experimental design and question,
* your data source and analysis pipeline, 
* any pitfalls you encountered
* a summary of your results and conclusions

 and Some examples include:

* Assembling a _de novo_ transcriptome from an SRA experiment, annotating the transcripts, and quantifying FPKMs for each gene. Extracting interesting genes for a biological question. 
* 

If you have your own data, you are encouraged to use that. We are here to help!
