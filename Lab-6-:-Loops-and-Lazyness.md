So far in this course, we have been working on one analysis at a time. What if we resequence two, ten, or hundreds of individuals, and want to run the same analysis on all individuals? Since we don't want to individually type commands, then wait, then type again -- we can make the computer work for us. To do this, we use loops.  

We will talk about two types of loops today, the "for" loop and the "while" loop. We will implement both types in the bash language in unix.
