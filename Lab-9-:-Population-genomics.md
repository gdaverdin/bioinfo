Diversity is the spice of life. 

Today you will be using the Human 1000 genome project data from a set of individuals to characterize diversity along chromosome 1. We will calculate allele frequency, measures of pairwise diversity (pi), signatures of selective sweeps (Tajima's D), transition/transversion (Ts/Tv) rate, and other various population metrics.
